#Snapping-Window-script
======================

Perl script that allows to snap a window to the right or to the left of the screen. When used with dual monitors it also allows to move one window from one monitor to the other

##NOTE
======================
This was only tested on Linux Mint 17, feel free to test it in other distros.

##Dependencies
======================
Before using this script you need to install, if you haven't them already, `wmctrl`, `xrandr`, `xprop` and `xwininfo`

##Usage
======================
Just clone this repo into any folder, then on your system settings define two combinations of keys, of your choice, one for snapping/moving the window to the left and the other for snapping/moving the window to the right. Assign them to the bash scripts move_left.sh and move_right.sh respectively.
